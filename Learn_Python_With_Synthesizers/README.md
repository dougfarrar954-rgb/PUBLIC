## Overview

This repository is a **complete Python learning curriculum** that teaches programming concepts through the creative lens of **audio synthesis and digital signal processing (DSP)**. Every lesson connects Python skills directly to sound generation, making abstract concepts immediately tangible and audible.

### What Makes This Different?

- 🎵 **Hear Your Code**: Every concept produces sound—turning abstract logic into audible results
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Tutoring**: Designed to work with Google Antigravity agent for guided, scaffolded learning
- 📚 **Self-Guided**: Complete with all curriculum files, examples, and tests—no external dependencies
- 🔧 **Production-Ready**: Professional test suite, validation tools, and audio helpers included
- 🌉 **Skills Transfer**: Final module bridges audio synthesis to general programming (data science, game dev, finance)

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AI-Community-Shared/Learn_Synth_Python_Curriculum.git
cd Learn_Synth_Python_Curriculum

# Create virtual environment (Optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Start Your Learning Session (CRITICAL)

To begin, run the session initializer. **This script will validate your environment, create your progress tracker, and provide a text block for you to paste into the AI chat to initialize your tutor.**

```bash
python start_session.py
```

### 3. Your First Sound

```bash
python examples/module_01/white_noise.py
```

See [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Curriculum Structure

The course is organized into modules progressing from absolute Python basics to complete synthesizers. **Absolute beginners should start with Module 0.**

| Module | Topic | Python Concepts | Audio Concepts |
|--------|-------|----------------|----------------|
| 0 | **Python Foundations** | Variables, Loops, Functions | Audio calculations, logic |
| 1 | **Digital Foundations** | NumPy arrays, types | Sampling, bit depth, white noise |
| 2 | **Waveforms** | Arithmetic, linspace | Sine, square, sawtooth, triangle |
| 3 | **Envelopes** | Class structures | ADSR, amplitude shaping |
| 4 | **Sequencing** | Timing, beat math | Patterns, rhythms, BPM |
| 5 | **Additive Synth** | Iteration, summation | Harmonics, partials, timbre |
| 6 | **Filters** | Signal processing | Low-pass, high-pass, resonance |
| 7 | **LFOs** | Modulation logic | Tremolo, vibrato, depth |
| 8 | **Effects** | Buffers, delays | Echo, reverb, feedback |
| 9 | **Sampling** | File I/O, binary data | WAV files, playback, triggers |
| 10 | **Generative** | Randomness, probability | Procedural composition |
| 11 | **GUI** | Event handling | Real-time parameter control |
| 12 | **MIDI** | Protocols, bitwise math | Note input, velocity, polyphony |
| 13 | **Bridge to General** | **Transfer to**: Data science, game dev, finance | Pattern extraction, abstraction |

## Learning Pathways

### With Antigravity Agent (Recommended)

The curriculum is designed to work with **Google Antigravity** as your AI tutor:

1. Open this project in VS Code with Antigravity extension
2. Run `python start_session.py` in the terminal
3. **Copy the 'ACTION REQUIRED' block** from the terminal and paste it into the Antigravity chat
4. The agent will adopt the **Synth-Tutor** persona and guide you through your current module

**Teaching Mode**: The agent uses the [Synth-Tutor system prompt](prompts/synth_tutor_system.md) which emphasizes:
- 🧩 Scaffolding (hints, not answers)
- 🔊 Audio-first learning (always connecting code to sound)
- 🐛 Guided debugging (discovery-based problem solving)

### Self-Guided Learning

You can also follow the curriculum independently:

1. Navigate to `curriculum/MODULE_01_Foundations/`
2. Read `MODULE_01_OVERVIEW.md`
3. Follow lessons sequentially: `1_1`, `1_2`, `1_3`, `1_4`
4. Run corresponding example scripts in `examples/module_01/`
5. Complete checkpoint projects

**Track Progress**: Copy `curriculum/PROGRESS_TRACKER.json` to your own file and update as you complete modules.
