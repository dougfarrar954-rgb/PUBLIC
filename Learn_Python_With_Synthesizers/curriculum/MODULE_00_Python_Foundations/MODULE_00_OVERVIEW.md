# Module 0: Python Foundations

## Overview
**Duration:** 1 week (4-6 hours)  
**Goal:** Learn core Python syntax and concepts needed for audio synthesis programming.

This module covers fundamental Python concepts WITHOUT audio synthesis. Once you master these basics, you'll apply them to sound generation in Module 1.

## Lessons

### 0.1: Variables, Print, and Basic Math
- [0_1_Variables_Print_Math.md](./0_1_Variables_Print_Math.md)
- Python as a calculator
- Storing values in variables
- Printing output to console

### 0.2: Control Flow (if/else, for loops)
- [0_2_Control_Flow.md](./0_2_Control_Flow.md)
- Making decisions with `if/else`
- Repeating actions with `for` loops
- Understanding indentation

### 0.3: Functions and Lists
- [0_3_Functions_Lists.md](./0_3_Functions_Lists.md)
- Creating reusable functions
- Storing collections in lists
- Passing arguments and returning values

### 0.4: Introduction to NumPy Arrays
- [0_4_NumPy_Introduction.md](./0_4_NumPy_Introduction.md)
- Why we use NumPy for audio
- Creating arrays
- Array operations (the foundation for DSP)

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Module 0, you will be able to:
- ✅ Write and run basic Python scripts
- ✅ Use variables, conditionals, and loops
- ✅ Define and call functions
- ✅ Work with lists and NumPy arrays
- ✅ Understand Python error messages

## Checkpoint Project

**Build a "Number Pattern Generator"**

Create a script that:
1. Takes user input for a pattern type (fibonacci, squares, primes)
2. Generates the first 10 numbers in that pattern
3. Stores them in a list
4. Prints the results

This project uses all core concepts you'll need for audio synthesis, but without the complexity of sound yet.

## Next Steps

After completing Module 0, you'll move to **Module 1: Foundations** where you'll use these Python skills to generate your first sounds!
