# Module 1: Foundations – Sound, Sampling, and Numbers

## Overview
**Duration:** 1 week (4-6 hours)  
**Goal:** Understand how digital audio works and generate your first sounds in Python.

This module teaches the fundamentals of digital audio: how continuous sound waves become discrete numbers that computers can process. You'll set up your audio environment and create your first synthesized sounds!

## Prerequisites
- ✅ Module 0: Python Foundations completed
- ✅ Python basics (variables, functions, loops, NumPy)

---

## Lessons

### 1.1: How Sound Becomes Numbers
- [1_1_Sound_Sampling_Numbers.md](./1_1_Sound_Sampling_Numbers.md)
- **Big Idea**: Sound is continuous waves; computers store discrete numbers sampled at regular intervals
- **Project**: White Noise Generator

### 1.2: Your First Sine Wave
- [1_2_First_Sine_Wave.md](./1_2_First_Sine_Wave.md)
- **Big Idea**: Sine waves are the building block of all sound; frequency determines pitch
- **Project**: Controllable Tone Generator

### 1.3: Setting Up Your Audio Toolkit
- [1_3_Audio_Toolkit_Setup.md](./1_3_Audio_Toolkit_Setup.md)
- **Big Idea**: Professional audio work requires the right libraries in an isolated environment
- **Project**: Verify audio playback works

### 1.4: Review & Integration Project
- [1_4_Integration_Project.md](./1_4_Integration_Project.md)
- **Big Idea**: Combine everything to create a musical sequence
- **Project**: Tone Ladder Sequencer

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Module 1, you will be able to:
- ✅ Explain how digital audio sampling works
- ✅ Generate and play white noise
- ✅ Create sine waves at any frequency
- ✅ Save audio to WAV files
- ✅ Build simple musical sequences

---

## Key Concepts
- Sample rate (44.1 kHz, 48 kHz)
- Bit depth (16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit float)
- Amplitude and clipping
- Frequency and pitch
- NumPy arrays as audio samples

---

## Next Steps

After completing Module 1, you'll move to **Module 2: Waveforms & Oscillators** where you'll explore different wave shapes and their timbral characteristics!
