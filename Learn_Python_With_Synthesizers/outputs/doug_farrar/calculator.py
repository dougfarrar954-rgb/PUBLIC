# Lesson 0.1: Variables, Print, and Basic Math
# Practice file for Doug Farrar

# Part A: Python as a Calculator
# Try these basic math operations:

print(5 + 3)        # Addition
print(10 - 4)       # Subtraction
print(7 * 6)        # Multiplication
print(20 / 5)       # Division
print(2 ** 3)       # Exponent (2 to the power of 3)

# Part B: Storing Values in Variables
# Now let's store some values:

frequency = 440
duration = 2.5
volume = 0.8
print(frequency)

# Part C: Using Variables in Calculations

sample_rate = 44100
duration = 2
total_samples = sample_rate * duration
print(total_samples)
