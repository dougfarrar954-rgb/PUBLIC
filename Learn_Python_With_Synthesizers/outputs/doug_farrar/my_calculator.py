# ## Hands-On Project
# Create a script called `my_calculator.py` that:
# 1. Stores your age in a variable
# 2. Calculates how many days you've been alive (approximately: age * 365)
# 3. Prints the result with a message

#  Example output: `I am approximately 9125 days old!`

age = 58
print(f"I am approximately {age * 365} days old!")
